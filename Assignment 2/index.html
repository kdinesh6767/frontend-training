        <h2>Lee, Bruce</h2>
        <p>His mother named him Lee. Bruce Lee was born in the Chinese year of the dragon, in the hour of the dragon on November 27, 1940. From the beginning, it was obvious he was a remarkable and unique child with tremendous energy. Bruce's favorite saying from when he was just starting Kung Fu up to when he died was, "As long as I can remember, I feel I have had this great creative and spiritual force within me that is greater than faith, greater than ambition, greater than confidence, greater than determination, greater than vision. It is all combined. My brain becomes magnetized with this dominating force, which I hold in my hand." Bruce had learned this from Master Sifu Yip Man.
