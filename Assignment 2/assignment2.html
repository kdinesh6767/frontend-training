                    <h1>SIRIUS BLACK</h1>
                    <p>Sirius Black is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, played by Gary Oldman. Black, also known as Padfoot or Snuffles (in his Animagus form) was a pure-blood wizard, the older son of Orion and Walburga Black, and the brother of Regulus Black. He is Harry Potter's godfather. He was the best friend of Harry's father, James Potter, along with Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. 
                       These four were known as the marauders in their school days, and were attributed with creating the Marauder's Map.He, along with his three friends, belonged to Gryffindor house when at Hogwarts, unlike the rest of his family, who had belonged to the house of Slytherin. He disliked his family very much, and ran away from home to James' house when he was sixteen. His prized possession in his youth was a flying motorbike.
